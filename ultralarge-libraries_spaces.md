## Ultra-large compound libraries and spaces

Summary of chemical compound libraries and spaces with sizes of at least 50 million compounds. Type describes whether a resource is *enumerated*, i.e. contains fully elaborated compounds or represents a *non-enumerated* space
where compounds are described by building blocks and reactions.
