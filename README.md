# ultralarge-VS
Maintained collection of resources for ultralarge virtual screening (VS), including ultra-large libraries, repositories of screening software, pre-prepared libraries and benchmarking datasets.

These are online versions of selected tables from our book chapter 'Ultra-Large-Scale Virtual Screening' in the book 'Computer-Aided and Machine Learning-Driven Drug Design - 
From Theory to Applications', that receive regular updates of the contents.
